## Requirements

1. Create a contact list component with the following features:
   - Display a list of contacts with their name, avatar, and mobile number.
   - Implement a search bar to filter contacts based on the search term. The search should be performed using character count, not an exact match.
   - Highlight the matching characters in the contact names based on the search term.
   - Show a "No contacts found" message when no contacts match the search term.
2. Use the provided `contactListData.json` as the data source for contacts.
3. Ensure the search is case-insensitive and supports partial matches.
